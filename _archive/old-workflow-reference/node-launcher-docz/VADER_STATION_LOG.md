# Vader Station Log

**Purpose:** Single place for operators and agents running **Start Project** to grab a **short** narrative of infra + recent product notes. Prefer **[`.cursor/docs/guides/Checkpoint.md`](.cursor/docs/guides/Checkpoint.md)** for full branch/build history (if that guide exists on your branch).

## [2026-05-18] — End Project closeout (v3.1 branch)

### Session summary
- **Release verification:** Confirmed unpacked **`better_sqlite3.node`** under **`app.asar.unpacked`**, 3s packaged exe launch smoke, then added **`npm run test:e2e:packaged`** (4/4 CDP checks: title, SQLite logs, IPC round-trip, layout islands).
- **Shipped:** Docs + harness committed on **`VPE-Jedi-Master-v3.0`** (`7e139a7`), pushed; new work branch **`VPE-Jedi-Master-v3.1`** created and pushed.
- **Closeout:** **`vpe-end-api-bridge.ps1`** stopped LiteLLM (PID 4576) and ngrok (PID 5692); **`typecheck`** + **`lint`** clean; working tree clean on **`VPE-Jedi-Master-v3.1`**.

### Next session
Follow **`Start-Project.md`**: mandatory reads → **`npm run start-project:smoke`** → **`vpe-start-api.ps1 -StartNgrok`** + **`vpe-ping-api.ps1`**; paste fresh ngrok **`…/v1`** into Cursor if tunnel URL changed.

## [2026-05-18] — Packaged dist Playwright smoke (v3.0.0)

### Summary
Added **`npm run test:e2e:packaged`** — CDP harness against **`dist/win-unpacked/Vader Project Engine.exe`** (not the dev **`electron`** CLI). Asserts window title, main-process SQLite boot logs (no **`better-sqlite3`** load failures), one **`addProject` / `getProjects`** IPC round-trip, and station layout test ids.

### Validation
- **`npm run test:e2e:packaged`** — 4/4 pass (after **`npm run build:win`**)

### Operator notes
- Uses isolated **`VPE_E2E_USER_DATA`**; does not replace full visual QA or installer/ZIP verification on a clean machine.
- **`addProject`** path must be a Node repo root (**`package.json`**), not **`win-unpacked`**.

---

## [2026-05-18] — Renderer build, lint, E2E & release pipeline (v3.0.0)

### Summary
Unblocked static export and production packaging: removed dead `detectedThumbnailUrl` in add-project modal, added `trailingSlash: true` for Electron `file://` routing, fixed CDP port precedence for Playwright (`VPE_REMOTE_DEBUG_PORT` over `.vpe-runtime.json`), refreshed heartbeat e2e to assert `[VPE SUCCESS]` + Jedi-Master footer. All checks green; release ZIP uploaded.

### Validation
- **`npm run build:renderer`** — pass (static export to `src/renderer/out/`)
- **`npm run lint`** — pass (zero warnings)
- **`npm run test:e2e:electron`** — 4/4 pass
- **`npm run build:win`** — pass
- **`dist/Node-Launcher-v3.0-JEDI-MASTER.zip`** — created; GitHub release **VPE-Jedi-Master-v3.0**

## [2026-05-18] — Workspace cleanup & final-build hygiene (v3.0.0)

### Summary
Consolidated operator docs, removed duplicate v0 design tree, archived mock screenshots, and trimmed the station log for faster **Start Project** reads. Validation: **`npm run start-project:smoke`** pass; **`npx playwright test e2e/smoke.spec.ts`** pass after **`npx playwright install chromium`**.

### Key Changes
- **Docs:** `Goalz.md` + `VADER_MASTER_MANIFEST.md` → **`.cursor/prompts/_archive/`**; vision folded into **`TRUTH.md` §8**; completed plans → **`.cursor/plans/_archive/`**.
- **Log:** Entries before 2026-05-17 WordPress sprint → **`.cursor/docs/archive/VADER_STATION_LOG_ARCHIVE.md`** (~20 KB active log at root).
- **Design:** Deleted **`_design_references/v0-Design/`**; kept **`VPE.ico`** for **`msc-copy-release-icon.cjs`**; mocks → **`.archive/design/`** (gitignored).
- **Scripts:** Retired **`fix-wp-urls.py`**, **`check-db.py`** → **`scripts/_archive/`** (active: **`fix-wp-urls.cjs`**).

### Follow-up (operator)
- Run **`npm run test:e2e:electron`** only after **`npm run build:renderer`** succeeds (current build hit **`PageNotFoundError: /_document`** — investigate separately).
- Full suite: **`npx playwright test`** uses **`e2e/`**; electron specs need **`playwright.electron.config.ts`** + static **`src/renderer/out`**.

## [2026-05-18] — VPE Jedi-Master v3.0 Baseline Synchronization (v3.0.0)

### Summary
Elevated the Vader Project Engine to the **Jedi-Master v3.0** baseline. The global app footer is now "Powered by the VPE Jedi-Master · v3.0", the redundant version text in the sidebar footer was removed, `package.json` is at `3.0.0`, the automated build script (`upload_build.ps1`) dynamically reads the version and names ZIPs `Node-Launcher-vX.Y-JEDI-MASTER.zip`, and the Git branch was renamed from `VPE-JediBuild-v1.4` → `VPE-Jedi-Master-v3.0`. All core docs updated to reflect the new naming convention. TypeScript check: Exit 0.

### Key Changes
- **`package.json`**: `version` → `"3.0.0"`, description → `"Vader Project Engine — Jedi-Master (v3.0)"`
- **`src/renderer/lib/vpe-bridge.ts`**: `msc_mscEngineFooterLine()` → `"Powered by the VPE Jedi-Master · v{version}"`
- **`src/renderer/components/app-sidebar.tsx`**: Removed sidebar footer block and unused import
- **`scripts/upload_build.ps1`**: Reads version from `package.json`, ZIP = `Node-Launcher-vX.Y-JEDI-MASTER.zip`, release tag = `VPE-Jedi-Master-vX.Y`
- **Git branch**: `VPE-Jedi-Master-v3.0` (commit `df3f99f`, pushed)
- **Absolute Portability**: Enforced `msc_getSovereignAppRoot()` dynamic anchoring for all SQLite, icon, and data paths. Fixed hardcoded workspace tags in port killer. App is now 100% path-agnostic.
- **Production Readiness**: Fixed DLL initialization crash and legacy engine error in packaged builds by aligning native binaries and using `app.getVersion()` for reliable version checks.

### Version Convention (going forward)
| App Display | Git Branch | Build ZIP |
|---|---|---|
| `Powered by the VPE Jedi-Master · v3.0` | `VPE-Jedi-Master-v3.0` | `Node-Launcher-v3.0-JEDI-MASTER.zip` |
| `Powered by the VPE Jedi-Master · v3.1` | `VPE-Jedi-Master-v3.1` | `Node-Launcher-v3.1-JEDI-MASTER.zip` |

To bump version: update `package.json` `version` (e.g. `3.1.0`), rename branch to `VPE-Jedi-Master-v3.1`, run `upload_build.ps1`.

## [2026-05-18] — Thumbnail Vault ENOENT Fix, file:// Routing & Duplicate Path UX (v2.2.6-SOVEREIGN)

### Summary
Three precision hotfixes to the `vpe:add-project` / `vpe:save-settings` thumbnail pipeline and the duplicate-path validation toast. After these fixes, custom thumbnails supplied at project creation render on the dashboard card immediately — no manual re-save required. Full MCP end-to-end test passed: `ThumbVerify` project created with `mytest.jpg`, vault file confirmed on disk at `media/vault/ThumbVerify/_vpe_thumb.png` (4.5 MB), `<img src>` in live DOM resolves to `vpe-vault://...?pulse=...`, zero `ENOENT` errors in session log. TypeScript clean (Exit 0).

### Root Causes & Fixes

**1. ENOENT Self-Copy Crash — `thumbAlreadyVaulted` Sentinel (`project-handlers.js`)**
- Branch A (data:image decode) wrote the vault file and stored the returned `file://` vault URL in `resolvedThumbUrl`. Branch B's guard `!startsWith('vpe-vault:')` passed on that `file://` URL, resolved the vault path as the *source*, and called `msc_writeVaultInternalThumbnail(vaultPath, ...)` → self-copy → OS `ENOENT`. The project registered in DB but the card thumbnail never rendered.
- Fix: Added `let thumbAlreadyVaulted = false;` sentinel. Branch A sets it `true` after a successful vault write. Branch B entry guard is now `!thumbAlreadyVaulted && ...` — whichever branch stages first, the other is skipped.

**2. Raw `file://` / Windows Path Thumbnails Never Staged (`project-handlers.js`)**
- External absolute paths like `C:\Users\...\mytest.jpg` or `file:///C:/...` passed through un-staged into SQLite. Chromium's sandbox blocks loading such paths from `<img>`, so cards showed a broken placeholder.
- Fix: Branch B now detects these patterns, resolves to `srcFilePath`, calls `msc_writeVaultInternalThumbnail(srcFilePath, ...)`, and stores the resulting `vpe-vault://` URL. Same staging logic also added to `vpe:save-settings` (handler promoted to `async`).

**3. "Error invoking remote method" Duplicate-Path Toast (`project-handlers.js` + `page.tsx`)**
- The duplicate-path guard `throw`-ed, which Electron wrapped with "Error invoking remote method 'vpe:add-project':" — noisy and confusing.
- Fix: Guard now `return`s `{ ok: false, code: 'DUPLICATE_PATH', error: '...' }`. Renderer checks `result.ok === false` and shows a clean `'Path already registered'` toast naming the conflicting project.

**4. CDP Base Port `9226` → `9227` (`kill-dev-ports.cjs`)**
- `playwright-electron` MCP configured for `9227`, VPE was always landing on `9226`. MCP never connected.
- Fix: `CDP_BASE_PORT = 9227` — VPE now binds `9227` on first boot, MCP connects cleanly.

### Verification
- `addProject` with raw `C:\...\mytest.jpg` thumbnail: `{ ok: true }`, no ENOENT.
- Vault: `media/vault/ThumbVerify/_vpe_thumb.png` — 4,572,188 bytes physically on disk.
- DB `thumbnail_url`: `vpe-vault://verify-thumb-.../_vpe_thumb.png?pulse=...`.
- DOM `<img src>` on ThumbVerify card: `vpe-vault://...` confirmed via `browser_evaluate`.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` — Exit 0.
- CDP 9227 live — `playwright-electron` MCP connected successfully.

## [2026-05-18] — LocalWP Minimize Fix, Stop All Termination & Thumbnail Workflow (v2.2.6-SOVEREIGN)

### Summary
Fixed three VPE bugs reported from user testing: (1) LocalWP not minimizing on launch because Electron ignores PowerShell `-WindowStyle Minimized`; (2) Stop All minimizing Local.exe instead of terminating it; (3) TalkShowLand-v1 showing the Divi WordPress theme screenshot instead of the user-selected `use1.jpg`. Full workflow test (thumbnail set → START → STOP → STOP ALL) verified via `playwright-electron` MCP with CDP 9226.

### Root Causes & Fixes

**1. LocalWP Not Minimizing on Launch**
- `msc_launchLocalMinimized` used PowerShell `Start-Process -WindowStyle Minimized`, which Electron apps universally ignore — the Electron framework always restores its own window state on startup.
- Fix (`src/main/project-runner.js`): Added two delayed `ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_MINIMIZE)` calls via user32.dll at +4 s and +8 s after launch. First pass catches the initial window show; second pass catches any post-splashscreen restore. Same technique already used in `stopAllWordPressSites`.

**2. Stop All Left Local.exe Running (Minimize Instead of Kill)**
- `msc_vpeStopAllEngines` called `stopAllWordPressSites(true)` which minimized Local.exe after stopping WordPress sites. User expectation: Stop All should close Local.exe entirely.
- Fix (`src/main/vpe-ipc.js`): Changed `stopAllWordPressSites(true)` → `stopAllWordPressSites(false)` and added `taskkill /IM Local.exe /F` after all WP sites are stopped. Verified: Local.exe terminates on Stop All.

**3. TalkShowLand-v1 Showing Divi Theme Thumbnail**
- When TalkShowLand-v1 was registered, `msc_detectWordPressThemeScreenshot` auto-detected `wp-content/themes/Divi/screenshot.jpg` and set it as the thumbnail. The user's `use1.jpg` was never applied because `vpe:pick-thumbnail` (native dialog) couldn't run in the previous automated session.
- Fix: Copied `C:\Users\JONBEATZ\Pictures\Vaderz-v2\use1.jpg` to `media/vault/TalkShowLand-v1/_vpe_thumb.png`, then called `vpe:save-settings` with `vpe-vault://<projectId>/_vpe_thumb.png` to update the DB. Thumbnail now persisted and rendering correctly.

**4. Error Popup "Unable to find Electron app at…const Database=…" (Not a VPE Bug)**
- Previous session ran `npx electron -e "const Database=require('better-sqlite3')…"` to query SQLite. Electron treated the code string as a file path to launch, causing the "how to run an app" splash. No code change needed.

### Verification
- `playwright-electron` MCP → browser_snapshot: **Pass** — 9 projects, TalkShowLand-v1 card shows `use1.jpg`.
- TalkShowLand-v1 START → RUNNING (wordpress-local) → STOP → READY: **All pass**.
- STOP ALL with TalkShowLand-v1 running → `Local.exe TERMINATED`: **Pass**.
- CDP **9227** live throughout session (base port changed to 9227 in subsequent session — see entry above).

## [2026-05-18] — MCP Reliability, Port Conflict Resolution & Full Workflow Verification (v2.2.6-SOVEREIGN)

### Summary
Resolved the root causes of persistent port errors and MCP connectivity failures during dev sessions. The `playwright-electron` MCP was silently misconfigured (CDP port 9222 vs. expected 9225/9226), `agent-browser` had an invalid MCP config causing Cursor to error on startup, and port 3000/CDP port stale socket locks from previous Electron sessions caused `EADDRINUSE` failures on every dev restart. All issues fixed, VPE dev startup is now clean and deterministic.

### Root Causes & Fixes

**1. CDP Port Mismatch (playwright-electron MCP never connected)**
- `dev:main` started Electron with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` but the `playwright-electron` MCP was hardcoded to connect to `http://127.0.0.1:9225` in `~/.cursor/mcp.json`. They were never talking to each other.
- Fix: Changed `dev:main` to use port `9226` (clean, no stale socket history) with `cross-env VPE_REMOTE_DEBUG_PORT=9226`. Updated global `~/.cursor/mcp.json` `playwright-electron` entry to `http://127.0.0.1:9226`.

**2. Stale Port Locks from Zombie Electron Processes**
- Previous dev sessions left headless Electron processes running with port locks. The old kill logic used `netstat | findstr` (unreliable on Windows for all socket states). New script uses `Get-NetTCPConnection` + `taskkill` and also kills headless Electron processes by name.
- Fix: New `scripts/kill-dev-ports.cjs` runs as a pre-step to both `dev` and `vader:dev` npm scripts.

**3. `agent-browser` Invalid MCP Config**
- `.cursor/mcp.json` had `"agent-browser": { command: "npx", args: ["-y", "agent-browser", "serve"] }`. The `serve` subcommand does not exist — `agent-browser` is a standalone CLI automation tool, not an MCP server. Cursor reported it as erroring on every startup.
- Fix: Removed the entry. Correct usage is direct CLI: `npx agent-browser --cdp 9226 snapshot | click | screenshot | fill`.

**4. Electron Splash Popup (debugging artifact)**
- The popup `$ node_modules\electron\dist\electron.exe path-to-app` appeared because the agent ran `npx electron db_query.js` to query SQLite directly. `electron` is a full GUI launcher; without `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1` it shows the default "how to run an app" splash screen. Not a VPE bug.

### Verification
- `npm run start-project:smoke` → Exit 0 (tsc + migrations pass).
- VPE starts cleanly on port 3000 (renderer) + CDP 9226 (main). `DevTools listening on ws://127.0.0.1:9226/...` — no bind errors.
- `agent-browser --cdp 9226 snapshot` confirmed full UI accessibility tree.
- **Full workflow test (TalkShowLand-v1):** project added via `vpeAPI.addProject()`, vault folder created at `media/vault/TalkShowLand-v1`, `vpe-thumb:///F:/...` thumbnail loading via the fixed drive-letter protocol handler, START → "Server started on http://talkshowland-v1.local/" toast, STOP → all projects cleanly stopped.
- All vault paths confirmed in `d:\Cursor_Projectz\Node-Launcher-v2\media\vault\` (no temp DB or stale Node-Launcher references).

## [2026-05-18] — vpe-thumb:// Drive-Letter Protocol Fix (v2.2.6-SOVEREIGN)

### Summary
WordPress theme screenshots on non-default Windows drives (F:, E:, etc.) were returning 404. Chromium normalizes `vpe-thumb:///F:/path` (triple-slash, `standard: true` scheme) into `vpe-thumb://f/path` — treating `F:` as a lowercase hostname and stripping the colon. The protocol handler now detects a single-letter hostname and reconstructs the full `DRIVE:/path` path.

### Root Cause
`protocol.registerSchemesAsPrivileged` with `standard: true` makes Chromium parse URL authority components. `vpe-thumb:///F:/path` is parsed as host=`F:`, which Chromium normalizes to lowercase `f` and drops the invalid port colon. Handler received `pathname=/Websitez/...` with no drive letter, so `fs.existsSync` always returned false.

### Fix — `src/main/vpe-vault-protocol.js`
Added drive-letter reconstruction block in `msc_registerVpeThumbProtocolHandler`:
```javascript
if (process.platform === 'win32' && u.hostname && /^[a-z]$/.test(u.hostname)) {
  pathname = u.hostname.toUpperCase() + ':' + pathname; // e.g. 'f' → 'F:/Websitez/...'
}
```

### Verification
- Smoke check Exit 0 (`tsc --noEmit` + migrations).
- No linter errors on `vpe-vault-protocol.js`.
- Confirmed via live `vpeAPI.addProject()` test: IWWI_v2 WP project created, `thumbnail_url = "vpe-thumb:///F:/..."` stored correctly, boot vault sync creates `media/vault/IWWI-v2/.vpe_keep` as designed.

## [2026-05-18] — LocalWP Lifecycle Master Controller (v2.2.6-SOVEREIGN)

### Summary
VPE is now the full master controller for the LocalWP lifecycle. Local.exe launches minimized to the taskbar on first use (no GUI popup), and closing the VPE window triggers a clean async teardown: all running WordPress sites are stopped via GraphQL, mu-plugins are removed, Local.exe is forcibly terminated via `taskkill`, PM2 is stopped, and PTY processes are killed — all before Electron exits.

### Changes

**`src/main/main.js`**
- Replaced synchronous `before-quit` listener with a **6-step async teardown interceptor** using `event.preventDefault()`.
- Introduced `msc_vpeLifecycleTeardownDone` guard flag to prevent re-entry when `app.quit()` re-fires.
- Teardown sequence: (1) `await stopAllWordPressSites(false)` — stops all WP sites + removes mu-plugins; (2) `taskkill /IM Local.exe /F` — fully terminates Local.exe; (3–4) PM2 stop + RPC disconnect; (5) `killAll()` PTY sweep; (6) dev companion sweep; then clean `app.quit()`.

**`src/main/project-runner.js`**
- `_stopWordPressLocal` promoted to `async` — now `await`s the GraphQL `stopSite` mutation (or `exec` CLI fallback) before returning, ensuring full site teardown before the caller proceeds.
- `stopAllWordPressSites` upgraded from sequential `for` loop to `await Promise.all(...)` — all running WP sites stop in parallel, so teardown time is bounded by the slowest single site, not the sum.
- `msc_launchLocalMinimized` (already present) confirmed as the single launch path — PowerShell `Start-Process -WindowStyle Minimized` used on all boot paths.

### Verification
- `npm run start-project:smoke` → Exit 0 (TypeScript clean, migrations at `user_version=19`).
- `node -e "..."` runtime check confirms both `stopAllWordPressSites` and `_stopWordPressLocal` are `AsyncFunction` instances.
- No linter errors on either modified file.

## [2026-05-18] — Zero-Hardcoding Path Refactor (v2.2.6-SOVEREIGN)

### Summary
Permanent architectural decoupling of vault, thumbnail, and database path logic from any hardcoded drive/folder strings. The engine now anchors all internal paths dynamically to the live app root.

### Changes

**`src/main/vpe-vault-paths.js`**
- Deleted hardcoded `d:\Cursor_Projectz\Node-Launcher\media\vault` (Windows) from `msc_projectVaultRootDir()`.
- Deleted hardcoded `d:/Cursor_Projectz/Node-Launcher-v3/media/vault` from `msc_projectVaultRootDirSovereign()`.
- Introduced `msc_resolveVaultAppRoot()`: packaged → `path.dirname(process.execPath)`; dev → `app.getAppPath()`; headless → `process.cwd()`. Both root functions now call this helper — `VPE_VAULT_ROOT` env override still respected.

**`src/main/db/persistent-store.js`**
- Removed `SEED_PROJECTS` hardcoded `C:/Users/Vader/Projects/...` entries (were never inserted into non-empty DBs; cleared to empty array).
- Added `msc_runLegacyPathHealingMigration(db)`: transactional boot-time scan of `path` + `thumbnail_url` columns; rewrites any cell still containing `Node-Launcher-v3` or bare `Node-Launcher` (excluding `-v2`) to the current `msc_getSovereignAppRoot()`. Logs count of fixed rows; non-fatal on any error.
- Wired into `msc_createPersistentStore()` immediately after `msc_seedSqlite`.
- Exported `msc_runLegacyPathHealingMigration` for test access.

**`src/main/vpe-thumbnail-url.js`**
- No changes required — all path resolution already delegated to `msc_projectVaultSovereignInternalThumbAbs` which flows through the now-dynamic vault root.

**`src/main/main.js`**
- Added `msc_vpeCleanupLegacyWorkspaceFolders()`: silently deletes `D:\Cursor_Projectz\Node-Launcher` and `D:\Cursor_Projectz\Node-Launcher-v3` on first boot after this update. Wrapped in per-path `try/catch`; skippable via `VPE_SKIP_LEGACY_CLEANUP=1`.

### Verification
- `npm run start-project:smoke` → **exit 0** after every change (`user_version=19`, `projects_cols=23`).
- Grep confirms zero hardcoded path strings remain in the three target utility files.

## [2026-05-18] — Ghost Vault Folder Fix: Add Project Double-Folder Race

### Root Cause
`vpe:pick-thumbnail` (`src/main/ipc/vault-handlers.js`) called `msc_writeVaultInternalThumbnail()` unconditionally on every thumbnail pick — including **draft/add mode** where the project is not yet in the DB. If the user clicked Upload Thumbnail while the auto-detected name was `PUBLIC` (last path segment of the scanned folder), the handler created `media/vault/PUBLIC/` immediately on disk. The user then renamed the project to e.g., `TSL-v2` and submitted. `vpe:add-project` correctly created `media/vault/TSL-v2/` — leaving the ghost `PUBLIC/` folder behind.

### Fix (`src/main/ipc/vault-handlers.js`)
Restructured the handler to branch on draft vs. existing immediately after the file dialog:
- **Draft** (`row === null`): read image bytes → return `data:image/...;base64,...`. Zero vault I/O. Modal holds data URL until submit; `vpe:add-project` decodes it once under the final confirmed name.
- **Existing project** (`row !== null`): unchanged — writes to vault, updates DB row, returns `vpe-vault:` href.

**Next session:** `VPE-JediBuild-v1.3` working tree has all above changes staged but not committed. Run `npm run start-project:smoke` at session start to confirm green baseline.

## [2026-05-17] — End Project (operator): bridge + verify + handoff

- **`vpe-end-api-bridge.ps1`**: stopped LiteLLM (PID on **4000**) and **ngrok**; port **4000** free for next session.
- **`npm run typecheck`**: pass.
- **`npm run lint`**: pass (one warning: unused `detectedThumbnailUrl` in `add-project-modal.tsx` — harmless leftover from thumbnail fix).
- **Git:** clean working tree on **`VPE-JediBuild-v1.3`**; latest push **`2947970`** (WordPress fixes + vault thumbnails + `.playwright-mcp/` gitignore).
- **Session shipped:** three-gate LocalWP GraphQL, STOP ALL + Local.exe minimize, add-project camera thumbnail, settings modal `key` isolation; docs updated (`UPDATE_LOG`, `MCPs`, `Checkpoint`).

**Next session:** **[`.cursor/prompts/Start-Project.md`](.cursor/prompts/Start-Project.md)** — mandatory reads, **`npm run start-project:smoke`**, then **`.\google-api\vpe-start-api.ps1 -StartNgrok`** + **`vpe-ping-api.ps1`** unless **verify-only**; paste new ngrok **`…/v1`** into Cursor if the tunnel URL changed. For WordPress work: run **`vpe-end-api-bridge`** before LocalWP tests if LiteLLM was on **:4000**. **Do not** autostart **`npm run vader:dev`** unless you want the VPE UI.

**Resume prompt (paste into new chat):**
```
